# ProjectBrewBuddy
By Rich, Jesse and Joe

Brewery-Buddies, an Android application, seamlessly integrates the Google Maps API to empower users in discovering local breweries based on zip code inputs. Users enjoy the flexibility to post, edit, and delete reviews for the breweries they discover, subsequently curating a personalized list of favorites. The app prioritizes security through Firebase authentication, ensuring a protected user experience. Notably, Brewery-Buddies employs Firebase for secure HTTP requests, facilitating the storage, editing, and removal of reviews for specific breweries. The application's intelligence shines by displaying only the favorited breweries relevant to the currently logged-in user. Thank you, enjoy!
